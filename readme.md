This repository implements Reat Course curriculum project.

My goal is to implement https://hn.ui.dev/ from scratch. The detailed instructions are found [here](https://github.com/uidotdev/react-course-curriculum).

After about 10 hours of work, I was able to run a succesfull project ðŸ‘Œ
I then spent some time refactoring the code based on the solution.
